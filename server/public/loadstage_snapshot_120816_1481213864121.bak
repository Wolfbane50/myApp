He influenced future NBA All Stars such as Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant, and is considered by many to be one of the most important players in NBA history. A prolific scorer who baffled opponents with his twists and turns and inventive moves, Baylor was a force both on and off the court for the Minneapolis and Los Angeles Lakers. In Elgin Baylor: The Man Who Changed Basketball, Bijan C. Bayne tells the story of how a kid from the streets of segregated Washington, DC, who didn’t attend college until he was over twenty, revolutionized basketball and stood up for his rights. In a time when few nationally prominent black athletes spoke out about racial inequality in the United States, Baylor refused to tolerate discrimination. On the court, with his balletic moves and urban style of play, Elgin Baylor lifted the game of basketball off the floor and into the air. Elgin Baylor: The Man Who Changed Basketball includes personal reflections from Baylor’s old schoolyard companions, former teammates, players he coached in the NBA, and noted sports journalists, bringing to life his childhood, college career, and professional life with intimate detail. Basketball fans, historians, and those interested in the impact of sports on the Civil Rights Movement will all find this first-ever biography of Elgin Baylor both fascinating and inspirational."},{"title":"Ember.js in Action","author":"Joachim Haagen Skeie","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LYxRmwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","category_id":10,"type_id":1,"url":"Ember.js in Action.pdf","publisher":"Manning Publications","copywrite":"2013-08-28","description":"Explains how to use Ember.js a JavaScript MVC framework that provides the patterns, components, and scaffolding needed to build web applications.","tag_list":"javascript"},{"title":"Emotional Agility","author":"Susan David","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yr62CgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","category_id":10,"type_id":1,"url":"Emotional Agility_ Get Unstuck, Embrace Change and Thrive in Work and Life (2016).epub","publisher":"Penguin","copywrite":"2016-09-06","description":"An Amazon Best Book of 2016 The counterintuitive approach to achieving your true potential, heralded by the Harvard Business Review as a groundbreaking idea of the year. The path to personal and professional fulfillment is rarely straight. Ask anyone who has achieved his or her biggest goals or whose relationships thrive and you’ll hear stories of many unexpected detours along the way. What separates those who master these challenges and those who get derailed? The answer is agility—emotional agility. Emotional agility is a revolutionary, science-based approach that allows us to navigate life’s twists and turns with self-acceptance, clear-sightedness, and an open mind. Renowned psychologist Susan David developed this concept after studying emotions, happiness, and achievement for more than twenty years. She found that no matter how intelligent or creative people are, or what type of personality they have, it is how they navigate their inner world—their thoughts, feelings, and self-talk—that ultimately determines how successful they will become. The way we respond to these internal experiences drives our actions, careers, relationships, happiness, health—everything that matters in our lives. As humans, we are all prone to common hooks—things like self-doubt, shame, sadness, fear, or anger—that can too easily steer us in the wrong direction. Emotionally agile people are not immune to stresses and setbacks. The key difference is that they know how to adapt, aligning their actions with their values and making small but powerful changes that lead to a lifetime of growth. Emotional agility is not about ignoring difficult emotions and thoughts; it’s about holding them loosely, facing them courageously and compassionately, and then moving past them to bring the best of yourself forward. Drawing on her deep research, decades of international consulting, and her own experience overcoming adversity after losing her father at a young age, David shows how anyone can thrive in an uncertain world by becoming more emotionally agile. To guide us, she shares four key concepts that allow us to acknowledge uncomfortable experiences while simultaneously detaching from them, thereby allowing us to embrace our core values and adjust our actions so they can move us where we truly want to go. Written with authority, wit, and empathy, Emotional Agility serves as a road map for real behavioral change—a new way of acting that will help you reach your full potential, whoever you are and whatever you face."},{"title":"Erlang Programming","author":"Francesco Cesarini, Simon Thompson","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Qr_WuvfTSpEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","category_id":10,"type_id":1,"url":"Erlang Programming.pdf","publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","copywrite":"2009-06-11","description":"This book is an in-depth introduction to Erlang, a programming language ideal for any situation where concurrency, fault tolerance, and fast response is essential.

The combination of MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, and Node.js has become so popular that it has earned the title MEAN stack -- the subject of this book. This book explores the MEAN stack in detail. We will begin by covering Node.js, as it will lay the groundwork for all of our server-side work. You will learn how to get Node running on your local machine as well as download modules using npm. The key aspects of the Node.js programming model will also be covered. From there, we will move on to MongoDB, where you'll learn how to interact with Mongo from a Node application. You will also learn how to create, retrieve, update, and delete data from a Mongo store. After you have a solid grasp on Node and Mongo, the book will move on to the Express web server. We'll cover the basics of Express applications via topics like routes and middleware. Building on previous chapters, we will cover the integration of Node, Mongo, and Express. Our coverage of the MEAN stack will wrap up with several chapters on AngularJS. These chapters will cover Angular fundamentals like data binding, directives, controllers, routing, and services. In an effort to explore competing technologies, a slight introduction to Ember.js will also be provided. Full stack JavaScript is not fully encompassed by the MEAN stack. There is an entire ecosystem of JavaScript tools to learn about, and this book will introduce a few of them. We will cover task runners Gulp.js and Grunt.js which are extremely useful for automating mundane, repetitive tasks. We'll also cover JSHint, a linting tool used to improve code quality. Linting tools analyze source code and report potentials issues - a feature that is especially useful in non-compiled languages like JavaScript."},{"title":"Essential Oils: The Ultimate Beginner's Guide to Uncovering the Healing Benefits of Aromatherapy","author":"Abigail Cruise","image_url":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51VZVt5L3dL._AC_UL115_.jpg","category_id":10,"type_id":1,"url":"Essential Oils - Abigail Cruise.epub","publisher":"CreateSpace Independent Publishing","copywrite":"2015","description":"You’re about to discover a whole new world of NATURAL healing that has become increasingly popular over the years.

While the basic protocols have changed little, new options such as Fast Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet have increased the complexity of the topic. Ethernet has been the flavor of choice for networking administrators since the early 1980s because of its ease of use and scalability. Written by one of the foremost experts on Ethernet standards and configuration, Charles E. Spurgeon, Ethernet: The Definitive Guide includes everything you need to know to set up and maintain an Ethernet network. Ethernet: The Definitive Guide teaches you everything you need to know about the IEEE 802.3 Ethernet standard and its protocols. The book is logically separated into five parts: Introduction to Ethernet provides a tour of basic Ethernet theory and operation, including a description of Ethernet frames, operation of the Media Access Control (MAC) protocol, full-duplex mode and auto-negotiation. Ethernet Media Systems is the heart of the book. This sectionof Ethernet: The Definitive Guide shows you how to build media-specific Ethernet networks, from a basic 10BASE-T Ethernet offering 10 Mbps over twisted-pair cables, to an advanced 1000BASE-X Gigabit Ethernet, providing up to 1 Gbps of data transfer over fiber optic cables. Building Your Ethernet System teaches you how to build twisted-pair and fiber optic media segments, as well as how to build your Ethernet using repeaters and hubs. Performance and Troubleshooting is divided into two chapters. The first describes both the performance of a given Ethernet channel, as well as the performance of the entire network system. The second includes a tutorial on troubleshooting techniques and describes the kinds of problems network administrators are likely to encounter. The last part of the book includes a complete glossary of terms used throughout the book, a resource list, descriptions of thick and thin coax-based Ethernet systems, a guide to AUI equipment installation and configuration, and a listing of troubleshooting numbers.

Together, the MongoDB database, the Express and AngularJS web application frameworks, and Node.js on the server-side constitute the MEAN stack, a powerful web development platform that uses JavaScript top to bottom. Developers love it because they need only one programming language for the whole stack. Business owners love it because the open source technologies in the MEAN stack are scalable and cost effective. Most importantly, end users love it because your web apps are fast and responsive. It's a win-win-win! Getting MEAN with Mongo, Express, Angular, and Node shows readers how to develop web applications end-to-end using the MEAN stack. It systematically discusses each technology in the MEAN stack helping to build up an application one layer at a time, just as in a real project. First, it tackles creating a skeleton of a static site in Express and Node, and pushing it up to a live web server. Next, it looks at the MongoDB database and how to build an API for an application. Finally, it rolls out Angular to handle data manipulation and application logic in the browser, demonstrating the payoff for organizing the back-end code properly. By the end of the book, readers will have all the skill—and code—needed to build a dynamic data-driven web application on the MEAN stack.

Before I met Q, my life was a big, twisted mess. Never enough money, never anyone to trust. No way out. With Q, the shame and fear disappear. Instead I feel pure pleasure, and that's something I've never had before. But if what I've just learned is true, we'd better enjoy every second together while we can...before our time runs out."},{"title":"JavaScript Object Programming","author":"Martin Rinehart","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=la9PCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","category_id":10,"type_id":1,"url":"JavaScript Object Programming.pdf","publisher":"Apress","copywrite":"2015-12-30","description":"This brief book explains the advantages of the object model, inheritance, both classical and prototypical, and shows how these concepts can be implemented in JavaScript. It also shows how object programming (OP) opens a new world of design possibilities that go far beyond inheritance. This book will help the intermediate JavaScript programmer learn to use both types of inheritance. For classical inheritance, it is accompanied by a substantial online system (a windowing UI library) that shows classical inheritance at its best. The same system shows how OP \"capabilities\" can eliminate much of the need for inheritance. For experienced JavaScript programmers, this book shows why most of the old views of JavaScript's inheritance have not done it justice. JavaScript classes inherit from JavaScript's prototypes, a fact that makes JavaScript's prototypes, when used correctly, functional equivalents to C++ classes (not to prototypes in true prototypical languages, like Self). JavaScript's object programming (not inheritance) is what separates it from classical OOP languages like C++ and Java. Most important, basing inheritance on JavaScript's prototypal chain is possible, but is not the best choice for prototypal inheritance or classical inheritance. What You'll Learn What are objects, JavaScript objects and object programming What is and how to use inheritance and JavaScript inheritance as well as inheritance alternatives How to design for JavaScript What are and how to use OO principles in JavaScript How to use Constructors with JavaScript and more AudienceThis book is for both intermediate and advanced JavaScript and Web development programmers. However, any programmer will understand the concepts and any JavaScript programmer should understand all of the concepts in this book. The code there is shows examples of the concepts discussed.","tag_list":"javascript"},{"title":"JavaScript Cookbook","author":"Shelley Powers","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vXJpBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","category_id":10,"type_id":1,"url":"JavaScript Cookbook.pdf","publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","copywrite":"","description":"Problem solving with JavaScript is a lot trickier now that its use has expanded considerably in size, scope, and complexity.

Both a riveting portrait of an abundantly human man and a vivid evocation of his time, JOHN ADAMS has the sweep and vitality of a great novel, taking us from the Boston Massacre to Philadelphia in 1776 to the Versailles of Louis XVI, from Spain to Amsterdam to London, where Adams was the first American to stand before King George III as a representative of the new nation. This is history on a grand scale -- a book about politics and war, but also about human nature, love, faith, virtue, ambition, friendship and betrayal, and the far-reaching consequences of noble ideas.

Understanding HTTP is essential for practically all web-based programming, design, analysis, and administration.While the basics of HTTP are elegantly simple, the protocol's advanced features are notoriously confusing, because they knit together complex technologies and terminology from many disciplines. This book clearly explains HTTP and these interrelated core technologies, in twenty-one logically organized chapters, backed up by hundreds of detailed illustrations and examples, and convenient reference appendices. HTTP: The Definitive Guide explains everything people need to use HTTP efficiently -- including the \"black arts\" and \"tricks of the trade\" -- in a concise and readable manner.In addition to explaining the basic HTTP features, syntax and guidelines, this book clarifies related, but often misunderstood topics, such as: TCP connection management, web proxy and cache architectures, web robots and robots.txt files, Basic and Digest authentication, secure HTTP transactions, entity body processing, internationalized content, and traffic redirection.Many technical professionals will benefit from this book. Internet architects and developers who need to design and develop software, IT professionals who need to understand Internet architectural components and interactions, multimedia designers who need to publish and host multimedia, performance engineers who need to optimize web performance, technical marketing professionals who need a clear picture of core web architectures and protocols, as well as untold numbers of students and hobbyists will all benefit from the knowledge packed in this volume.There are many books that explain how to use the Web, but this is the one that explains how the Web works. Written by experts with years of design and implementation experience, this book is the definitive technical bible that describes the \"why\" and the \"how\" of HTTP and web core technologies.

Then check out SSH, the Secure Shell, which provides key-based authentication and transparent encryption for your network connections. It's reliable, robust, and reasonably easy to use, and both free and commercial implementations are widely available for most operating systems. While it doesn't solve every privacy and security problem, SSH eliminates several of them very effectively. Everything you want to know about SSH is in our second edition of SSH, The Secure Shell: The Definitive Guide. This updated book thoroughly covers the latest SSH-2 protocol for system administrators and end users interested in using this increasingly popular TCP/IP-based solution. How does it work? Whenever data is sent to the network, SSH automatically encrypts it. When data reaches its intended recipient, SSH decrypts it. The result is \"transparent\" encryption-users can work normally, unaware that their communications are already encrypted. SSH supports secure file transfer between computers, secure remote logins, and a unique \"tunneling\" capability that adds encryption to otherwise insecure network applications. With SSH, users can freely navigate the Internet, and system administrators can secure their networks or perform remote administration. Written for a wide, technical audience, SSH, The Secure Shell: The Definitive Guide covers several implementations of SSH for different operating systems and computing environments. Whether you're an individual running Linux machines at home, a corporate network administrator with thousands of users, or a PC/Mac owner who just wants a secure way to telnet or transfer files between machines, our indispensable guide has you covered. It starts with simple installation and use of SSH, and works its way to in-depth case studies on large, sensitive computer networks.

Meditation teacher, Michael W. Taft gives you step-by-step instructions in the powerful and reliable techniques of mindfulness meditation, and outlines the psychological and neuroscientific research underpinning these practices. By treating mindfulness as a scientifically-based, psychological technique, you can keep your atheistic or agnostic secular skepticism and still maintain a powerful, regular, and deeply effective meditation practice. That's because meditation doesn't require you to believe in it to work. Like any good technology, if you use it correctly, it will do the job reliably whether you believe in it or not. And-make no mistake-meditation is a kind of technology; a technology for hacking the human wetware in order to improve your life. This book is a practical, hands-on manual about how to make the most of that technology for yourself. If you are smart, skeptical, technically-inclined, and have a desire to see what meditation is really all about, this book is for you. Michael has taught a lot of meditation programs at tech corporations like Google, so this material has been field-tested on some world-class geeks."},{"title":"The Pornography Industry","author":"Shira Tarrant","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-4WICwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","category_id":10,"type_id":1,"url":"The Pornography Industry - What Everyone Needs to Know (2016).pdf","publisher":"Oxford University Press","copywrite":"2016-03-01","description":"We may know pornography when we see it, but the business of pornography is a surprisingly elusive subject. Reliable figures about the industry are difficult to come by and widely disputed, but one matter that is hardly debatable is that pornography is a major and ubiquitous enterprise. Porn allegedly accounts for one-third of all internet traffic currently, though the data about actual consumption is unclear. Reports in recent years have suggested that 70 million individuals visit porn sites every week; that among viewers aged 18-24, women watch more porn than men; and that among middle-aged, white-collar workers, three-quarters of men and half of women have admitted to looking at pornography websites while at work. While debates and emotions around porn can run high, there is a crucial need for reliable information and rational conversation. In this book, Shira Tarrant parses the wide range of statistics that we have on the pornography industry, sorting myth from reality in an objective, fascinating and knowledgeable fashion. She looks at ongoing political controversies around the industry, the feminist porn wars, the views of the religious right, the history of pornography, landmark legal cases, and the latest in medical research. The Pornography Industry also explains the industry basics -who works in porn, why people become performers, how much they earn, and what happens on a porn set. It further delves into important questions such as: how many teenagers watch porn and should we worry about it? What is porn piracy and can it be stopped? What can the industry do about sexist and racist pornography? Does porn cause violence against women? Can people become addicted to porn? Is watching porn the same as infidelity? By presenting competing perspectives in an even-handed way, The Pornography Industry will enable readers to explore these provocative issues and make their own best decisions about the debates."},{"title":"The Social Media Job Search Workbook","author":"Joshua Waldman","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mXhLrgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","category_id":10,"type_id":1,"url":"The Social Media Job Search Workbook.epub","publisher":"CreateSpace","copywrite":"2015-02-16","description":"You've probably heard that social media can make or break your search for a job.

But can you also build web sites that are usable by machines? That's where the future lies, and that's what RESTful Web Services shows you how to do. The World Wide Web is the most popular distributed application in history, and Web services and mashups have turned it into a powerful distributed computing platform. But today's web service technologies have lost sight of the simplicity that made the Web successful. They don't work like the Web, and they're missing out on its advantages. This book puts the \"Web\" back into web services. It shows how you can connect to the programmable web with the technologies you already use every day. The key is REST, the architectural style that drives the Web. This book: Emphasizes the power of basic Web technologies -- the HTTP application protocol, the URI naming standard, and the XML markup language Introduces the Resource-Oriented Architecture (ROA), a common-sense set of rules for designing RESTful web services Shows how a RESTful design is simpler, more versatile, and more scalable than a design based on Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) Includes real-world examples of RESTful web services, like Amazon's Simple Storage Service and the Atom Publishing Protocol Discusses web service clients for popular programming languages Shows how to implement RESTful services in three popular frameworks -- Ruby on Rails, Restlet (for Java), and Django (for Python) Focuses on practical issues: how to design and implement RESTful web services and clients This is the first book that applies the REST design philosophy to real web services. It sets down the best practices you need to make your design a success, and the techniques you need to turn your design into working code.

Today, Rails developers and architects need better ways to interface with legacy systems, move into the cloud, and scale to handle higher volumes and greater complexity. In Service-Oriented Design with Ruby and Rails, Paul Dix introduces a powerful, services-based design approach geared toward overcoming all these challenges. Using Dix’s techniques, readers can leverage the full benefits of both Ruby and Rails, while overcoming the difficulties of working with larger codebases and teams. Dix demonstrates how to integrate multiple components within an enterprise application stack; create services that can easily grow and connect; and design systems that are easier to maintain and upgrade. Key concepts are explained with detailed Ruby code that was built using open source libraries such as ActiveRecord, Sinatra, Nokogiri, and Typhoeus. The book concludes with coverage of security, scaling, messaging, and interfacing with third-party services. Service-Oriented Design with Ruby and Rails will help you Build highly scalable, Ruby-based service architectures that operate smoothly in the cloud or with legacy systems Scale Rails systems to handle more requests, larger development teams, and more complex code bases Master new best practices for designing and creating services in Ruby Use Ruby to glue together services written in any language Use Ruby libraries to build and consume RESTful web services Use Ruby JSON parsers to quickly represent resources from HTTP services Write lightweight, well-designed API wrappers around internal or external services Discover powerful non-Rails frameworks that simplify Ruby service implementation Implement standards-based enterprise messaging with Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) Optimize performance with load balancing and caching Provide for security and authentication"},{"title":"0321604814 {701A7EE3} Rails Antipatterns  Best Practice Ruby on Rails Refactoring [Pytel & Saleh 2010 11 19]","author":null,"image_url":"http://localhost:3000/assets/document.gif","category_id":10,"type_id":1,"url":"Ruby and Rails/0321604814 {701A7EE3} Rails Antipatterns_ Best Practice Ruby on Rails Refactoring [Pytel & Saleh 2010-11-19].pdf"},{"title":"0321714636 {3D86EDC2} The Ruby Way (3rd ed ) [Fulton & Arko 2015 03 13]","author":null,"image_url":"http://localhost:3000/assets/document.gif","category_id":10,"type_id":1,"url":"Ruby and Rails/0321714636 {3D86EDC2} The Ruby Way (3rd ed.)

Now you can get in on the action as well.This book describes metaprogramming as an essential component of Ruby. Once you understand the principles of Ruby, including the object model, scopes, and eigenclasses, you're on your way to applying metaprogramming both in your daily work and in your fun, after-hours projects.Learning metaprogramming doesn't have to be difficult or boring. By taking you on a Monday-through-Friday workweek adventure with a pair of programmers, Paolo Perrotta helps make mastering the art of metaprogramming both straightforward and entertaining.The book is packed with: Pragmatic examples of metaprogramming in action, many of which come straight from popular libraries or frameworks, such as Rails.Programming challenges that let you experiment and play with some of the most fun, \"out-there\" metaprogramming concepts.Metaprogramming \"spells\"--34 practical recipes and idioms that you can study and apply right now, to write code that is sure to impress.Whether you're a Ruby apprentice on the path to mastering the language or a Ruby wiz in search of new tips, this book is for you."},{"title":"JRuby Rails Web Application Development","author":"Deepak Vohra","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Z4XBBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","category_id":10,"type_id":1,"url":"Ruby and Rails/3319039334 {0061D9D2} JRuby Rails Web Application Development [Vohra 2014-01-06].pdf","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","copywrite":"2014-01-06","description":"This SpringerBrief explains how to create a Rails web application with JRuby, a 100% Java implementation for Ruby.
