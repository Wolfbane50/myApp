This hands-on guide introduces you to AngularJS, the open source JavaScript framework that uses Modelâ€“viewâ€“controller (MVC) architecture, data binding, client-side templates, and dependency injection to create a much-needed structure for building web apps. Guided by two engineers who worked on AngularJS at Google, youâ€™ll walk through the frameworkâ€™s key features, and then build a working AngularJS appâ€”from layout to testing, compiling, and debugging. If you have JavaScript experience, youâ€™ll learn how AngularJS helps reduce the complexity of your web app. Dive deep into Angularâ€™s building blocks and learn how they work together Gain maximum flexibility by separating logic, data, and presentation responsibilities with MVC Assemble your full app in the browser, using client-side templates Use AngularJS directives to extend HTML with declarative syntax Communicate with the server and implement simple caching with the $http service Use dependency injection to improve refactoring, testability, and multiple environment design Get code samples for common problems you face in most web apps",
